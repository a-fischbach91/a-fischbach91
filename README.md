## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adrian, and I am finishing my master's degree in economics with a focus on econometrics and data analysis. Currently, I am working as a working student for the BioNTech SE in Mainz, Germany in Business Analytics, where I help my team building comprehensive dashboards and assist with supplier negotiation.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a dynamic webscraper for financial news.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to automate the search for the perfect hyperparameters for choosing the best ARIMA model.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced econometric data analysis
